# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This project predicts the IMDB rating of movies based on various features like genre, director, and cast. The dataset contains historical movie data from India. The goal is to build a regression model that estimates the IMDB rating of a movie.

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle's IMDB India Movies dataset and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies).

### Features
- `Title`: Name of the movie
- `Genre`: Genre of the movie
- `Director`: Director of the movie
- `Actor`: Main actors of the movie
- `Language`: Language of the movie
- `Budget`: Budget of the movie
- `Revenue`: Revenue generated by the movie
- `IMDB_Rating`: The rating given by IMDB (target variable)

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features (like Genre, Director)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize relationships between features and ratings

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train a Linear Regression model to predict movie ratings
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### Results
- RMSE: ~0.5
- Visualizations: [Provide scatter plots, correlation heatmap]
