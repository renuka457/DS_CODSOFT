# Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into one of three species based on their measurements (sepal and petal length and width). The dataset is a classic machine learning dataset used for classification problems.

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle's Iris Flower dataset and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).

### Features
- `SepalLengthCm`: Sepal length in cm
- `SepalWidthCm`: Sepal width in cm
- `PetalLengthCm`: Petal length in cm
- `PetalWidthCm`: Petal width in cm
- `Species`: The species of the iris flower (target variable)

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Handle missing values if any

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distribution of each feature
   - Visualize relationships between features and species

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify the species
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy score

### Results
- Accuracy: ~95%
- Visualizations: [Provide scatter plots, pair plots]
